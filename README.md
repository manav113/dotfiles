## Introduction

My dotfiles backup that ultilizes [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) and [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup). I recommend to read up the tools to understand how they work.

> NOTE: Please read the instruction very carefully before you run any command, script on your _existing_ environment. I highly recommend to take the parts you use only and not `restore` everything on your computer, since a lot of these tools are configured spefically for my needs. ðŸŒ¹

> NOTE: VSCode provide a sync feature which is much more sophisticated than dotfiles, so it is not used here.
>
> NOTE: Applications that doesn't store configuration files in `$HOME` or `$HOME/.config` are generally not included here.

### Security

The [mackup configuration](mackup/.mackup.cfg) consist of only `[applications_to_sync]` section to specifically limit what to sync. This avoid syncing any redundant files or files that includes sensitive information that you don't want to share.

## Getting started

### First steps

1. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:turbothinh/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles`
2. Navigate into the folder `cd  ~/dotfiles`
3. Pull all submodules `git submodule update --init --recursive`
4. Run bootstrap script `~/dotfiles/scripts/bootstrap-mac.sh`

### More steps

1. Set ZSH as a main shell: `chsh -s $(which zsh)`
2. Install runtimes: `rtx install`

## Manage backup

You can find the main mackup configuration [here](mackup/.mackup.cfg).

### Manage apps to sync or unsync

When you look into `mackup/.mackup` folder, you will see only the [my-dotfiles.cfg](mackup/.mackup/my-dotfiles.cfg) file. This is because I would like to have full control of what files I am backing up. I would recommend you to do the same.

To manage what app to sync, edit `mackup/.mackup.cfg`.

### Add apps to backup

I you want convenience, there are a bunch of supported applications. All supported applications can be found [here](https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/mackup/applications).

In case an application is not supported, you can add a `*.cfg` file to `./.mackup` folder.
Then update `mackup/.mackup.cfg`.

### Restore your application settings on a newly installed workstation.

Run `mackup restore`

### Backup configurations from machine

Run `mackup restore`

### Uninstall mackup

Run `mackup uninstall`

## Git Submodules

Sometimes, a library might not be available as a installable package (zplug, tmux-url-select, etc.), or it is just a repo that consist of data (cowsay, fortunes, etc.), we use git `submodule` to download the packages as well as keeping them up-to-date.

### Add a new submodule/package

Run `git submodule add https://github.com/new_plugin.git mackup/packages/new_plugin`

### Update/pull all submodules

Run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
